# TooClarity - Setup and Installation

Welcome to **TooClarity**, a React app! This guide will help you set up and install the project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm** (Node Package Manager) or **yarn**: Installed automatically with Node.js.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abinjustinkumaravel/tooclarity.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd tooclarity
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or if you are using Yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

## Running the App

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn start
```

This command will start the React app and open it in your default browser. By default, it will be running at `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Building for Production

To create an optimized production build, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will create a `build` folder with all the production-ready files.
